= Lab Guide: Introduction to the ansible-navigator Environment

_An introduction to the `ansible-navigator` tool and the `code-server` editor environment used in this lab._

---

== Introduction

[`ansible-navigator`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-navigator) is a textual user interface (TUI) available to Ansible Automation Platform subscribers. Introduced with Ansible Automation Platform 2, it serves as the primary interface for creating and testing Ansible automation. `ansible-navigator` also functions as a drop-in replacement for `ansible-playbook` and other `ansible-*` utilities.

In this lab, you will use `ansible-navigator` from within a web-based code editor environment called [`code-server`](https://github.com/cdr/code-server).

NOTE: `code-server` is not packaged with Ansible Automation Platform and is not affiliated with Red Hat.

== Task: Explore the Environment and Run a Test Playbook

Let's get started by opening the integrated terminal and running a few commands.

.   **Open a new terminal.** In the `code-server` interface, go to the top menu and select **Terminal** → **New Terminal**.

.   **Verify `ansible-navigator` installation.** At the terminal prompt, run the following command to quickly test that `ansible-navigator` is installed and view its options:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator --help
----

.   **Create a test playbook.** Now that you know `ansible-navigator` is installed, create a simple playbook file named `test.yml` in your home directory (`/home/rhel`). You can do this by right-clicking in the file explorer pane on the left and selecting "New File". Paste the following content into the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: this is just a test
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: ping test
      ansible.builtin.ping:
----
+
*Save* the file.

.   **Run the playbook with `ansible-navigator`.** Now, execute the playbook using `ansible-navigator` in standard output mode (`-m stdout`), which mimics the output style of `ansible-playbook`:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run ./test.yml -m stdout
----
+
You should see output similar to this, indicating successful execution against `localhost`:
+
[source,text]
----
[rhel@code-server ~]$ ansible-navigator run ./test.yml -m stdout

PLAY [this is just a test] *****************************************************
