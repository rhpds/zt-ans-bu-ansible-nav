= Lab Guide: Configuring Common ansible-navigator Options

_A guide to exploring and configuring common settings in `ansible-navigator.yml`._

---

== Introduction

`ansible-navigator` aims to unify the development experience, offering many configuration options that can be customized for each developer or project via the `ansible-navigator.yml` file. This is useful if your projects require different execution environments or Ansible defaults. Developers can also use these settings to adapt `ansible-navigator` to their preferred development style and code editor.

Let's explore some common configuration options.

---

== Task 1: Explore the Configuration File

First, examine the existing `ansible-navigator.yml` configuration file.

.   In the `code-server` file explorer on the left, **find** the `ansible-navigator.yml` file in your home directory (`/home/rhel`). **Open** it to view its contents. Notice the pre-configured settings related to execution environments and logging.

---

== Task 2: Configure the Editor for the `:open` Subcommand

A useful feature is the ability to open the output of any `ansible-navigator` screen in your preferred text editor using the `:open` subcommand. Let's configure this to use `code-server`.

.   **Add the editor configuration** to your `ansible-navigator.yml` file. **Copy** the following settings and **paste** them at the end of the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  editor:
    command: code-server {filename}
    console: false
----
+
**Save** the `ansible-navigator.yml` file.

---

== Task 3: Test the `:open` Subcommand

Now, run your test playbook again and try out the `:open` feature.

.   **Execute your test playbook** in the terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator run ./test.yml
----

.   **Navigate to a task's output.** Once the playbook finishes, **inspect the play** by pressing kbd:[0], then **inspect the first task** (Gathering Facts) by pressing kbd:[0] again.

.   **Open the task output in the editor.** Now, issue the `:open` subcommand by typing `:open` and pressing Enter. A new tab should open within `code-server`, displaying the detailed output (facts gathered) of that task.

NOTE: The `:open` subcommand works on any screen within the `ansible-navigator` TUI and can be very helpful when developing or debugging playbooks.
